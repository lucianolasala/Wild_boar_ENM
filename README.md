Introduction
----------  
This repository contains the R scripts and details of methods employed for the development of an ecological niche model (henceforth ENM) for Wild boar (*Sus scrofa*) in contiguous Argentina and neighboring countries.

A Maximum Entropy approach (https://biodiversityinformatics.amnh.org/open_source/maxent/) method was used inside the R programing environment (https://www.r-project.org/). The repository also aims to serve as a document for the methodology.  Rather than having everything in a single script, the code is divided in a series of separate scripts that should be run sequentially.  

Methodological approach
----------

[1. Remote sensing and climate data](./GEE-raster-processing/README.md)  
Clould computing using Google Earth Engine (https://earthengine.google.com/) is described for each of the variables included in model calibration and projection.

[2. Environmental data processing](./Environmental_data_processing.md)

[3. Variable selection](.Variable_selection.md)

[4. Occurrence data and model calibration](./Occurrences_& modelling/README.md)  
The process of data random allocation to training and testing sets used for model calibration and validation, respectively, is described. 

[5. Model calibration](./calibration/calibration.md)

[6. Model validation](./Validation/README.md)

[7. Plots](./plots)
