This repository contains R and Java scripts used for the development of an ecological niche model (henceforth ENM) for Wild boar (*Sus scrofa*) in Argentina and neighboring countries.
The repository is meand to serve as a dynamic document for other parties interested on the ecology of Wild boar and it will be updated as additional data is gathered and new methodological methods are developed. 
The code included is divided into a series of separate scripts that should be run sequentially.

A Maximum Entropy approach (https://biodiversityinformatics.amnh.org/open_source/maxent/) method was used inside the R programing environment (https://www.r-project.org/).
