### Google Earth Engine: a new cloud-computing platform for global-scale earth observation data and analysis  
For the present work, two different assets (i.e. calibration and projection areas) were defined using vector files (ESRI shapefiles). These were defined as M and G, respectively. In the code shown, remote sensing data are processed only for M by clipping each product to  that region. Codes for data processing corresponding to G are identical, with the only difference that G is used as the asset to define the area of interest.
